            </h4>
            <p>
                Yahtzee is a classic dice game that involves rolling five dice to achieve specific combinations and earn points. The game consists of 13 rounds, and in each round, the player can roll the dice up to three times to achieve the desired combination.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Architecture 
            </h4>
            <p>
                The Yahtzee game is implemented as a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Game flow
            </h4>
            <p>
                Game Start: The game initializes with a score card, dice and a roll button on a hand made custom background.
                Rolling Dice: 
                        - Clicking the roll button rolls the Dice
                        - The dice animation is displayed and the dice numbers are displayed
                Scoring:
                        - The player selects a combination of the dice to score based on the dice values.
                        - Once the score combnation is selected the scorecard is updated
                End of round:
                        - Once the score combination is selected, the total score is updated and the player progresses to the next round.
                Game End: 
                        - After the 13 rounds are played the game is done and the final score is displayed.

                The yahtzee game is a fun web based game that allows a player to pass some time and learn to play a common dice game!

                Overview

                Architecture 
            </h4>
            <p>
                The Yahtzee game is implemented as a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, allowing communication between the client and server.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Frontend
            </h4>
            <p>
                Front end styling, the game is rendered and allows for user interaction. The front end is done with HTML and CSS that allows for the structure and styling of the game interface
                Front end game logic, the logic is implemented with JavaScript, allowing for the dice rolling and communication with the server
            </p>
            <h4>
                Back end
            </h4>
            <p>
                The backend manages the game state, handles dice rolling logic, and communicates with the frontend. Key components include:

                        - Node.js: Provides the runtime environment for the server.
                        - Express: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies server-side development.

                We had some issues creating a seamless flow between the client and server. We are working at solving this issue!

                I hand made a custom background and added a custom score card to make my game look a little better. I spent a while on it and it looks good!

                During the construction of this project, I have developped a much larger and well defined knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.  

                HTTP & TCP/IP. In this project, I have gained a more solid foundation about the protocals of the internet and how the client and server devices communicate.

                In addition to learning the importance of creating content that is accessable to all people, including those with dissabilities, there was also a strong focus on overcoming issues and challanges that come with the designing and creation of an animated game with client-server capabilities
