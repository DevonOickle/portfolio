            <p>
                Yahtzee is a classic dice game that involves rolling five dice to achieve specific combinations and earn points. The game consists of 13 rounds, and in each round, the player can roll the dice up to three times to achieve the desired combination.
            </p>

            </h4>
            <p>
                Game Start: The game initializes with a score card, dice and a roll button on a hand made custom background.
                Rolling Dice: 
                        - Clicking the roll button rolls the Dice
                        - The dice animation is displayed and the dice numbers are displayed
                Scoring:
                        - The player selects a combination of the dice to score based on the dice values.
                        - Once the score combnation is selected the scorecard is updated
                End of round:
                        - Once the score combination is selected, the total score is updated and the player progresses to the next round.
                Game End: 
                        - After the 13 rounds are played the game is done and the final score is displayed.

            </h4>
            <p>
                The hospital triage web application is an app that allows for a user to check themselves in to a hospital or medical clinic. The user has to choose where their injury is on their body as well as what symptoms they are showing. This will then put them in the hospital database and will assign them a doctor who will take care of them.
            </p>

                Architecture
            </h4>
            <p>
                The hospital triage application is implimented as a web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the frontend. The backend is powered by Node.JS and Express which allows for the frontend to communicate with the database, which was implemented using MySQL workbench.

                Frontend
            </h4>
            <p>
                Front end styling is rendered and allows for user interaction. The frontend is done with HTML and CSS that creates structure and styling for the web page. Some front end capabilities are implemented with JavaScript, allowing for the switching between patient and doctor users in the login, and allowing for the patient to click on the part of the body in which they feel pain on an outline of a person.
            </p>
            <h4>
                backend
            </h4>
            <p>
                The backend manages the interaction between the database and the user input. Key components include Node.JS, which provides the runtime environment for the server, Express, which is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies server-side developmemt.
          </p>
          <h4>
                Database
          </h4>
          <p>
                The database is created and managed using MySQK workbench with the SQL DML language. The database stores information on the patients as they sign in to the triage, as well as doctors who are tasked with taking care of the patients. 
          </p>
          <h4>
                User interacion
          </h4>
          <p>
                Upon opening the triage webpage, the user is faced with a viually pleasing application where they have to select their role in the hospital. If they are a doctor, they can input their username and password. If they select patient, the options to put in Name, Age, Gender and Healthcard Number appears for them to see. After the patient submits their information, they are met with a screen that allows the user to select the body part in which they are feeling pain by clicking on the corresponding body part on a human outline. This part will appear in a box on the right which shows all the body parts in which they feel pain. Multiple body parts can be selected. Next a patient has to choose from a selection of sympotoms in a scroll box that match the symptoms they feel. Multiple symptoms can be selected and all the ssymptoms will appear in a text box to the right. Lastly, using a slider the patient must choose how much pain they are in. After submitting this information, the patient's information will be submitted to the database. 
          </p>
          <h4>
                Conclusion
          </h4>
          <p>
                The hospital triage app is an easy to use and visually appealing web application that takes a patient's injuries and inputs them into a hospital's database so a doctor can take a look at them.

                    We had some issues connecting the front end inputs to the database as the database was completed before all the requirements were known. THis is being attended to at the moment.

                    It took me a very long time to get the correct images in the correct spots, being the correct size and being able to be interracted with. In the end it worked and I think it looks and feels amazing to use.

                    I had made a custom background and added a custom image button which is integrated with other image buttons. The visuals certainly reflect how much time I put into the user inerface!

                    Even though it is not perfect, our databse integration with the front end user interface is a very cool concept and though this application, we have learned a lot about how web applications work and how to connect them with a database!
